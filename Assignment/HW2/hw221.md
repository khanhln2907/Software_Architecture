# How many unique states can the SmartHome system be in? What are the relevant state chaGCes?

Consider the light's status (LO: on / LOFF: off) and garage's status (GO: open / GC: close), we have four unique states:
    - Garage open, light on:    GO_LON
    - Garage open, light off:   GO_LOFF
    - Garage closed, light on:  GC_LON
    - Garage closed, light off: GC_LOFF

The relevant state chaGCes are:
    - GO_LON to GC_LON: notify Alice as she closed the garage without turning off the light. 
    - GO_LOFF -> GO_LON: notify Bob as he turned off the light without closing the garage 

Under the assumption that beiGC at home is equivalent to turning on the light, the notification should help the user approach users' final states ,which are: 
    - Alice is leaving the house, so it is supposed to be GO_LON -> GO_LOFF -> GC_LOFF. If she leaves the house without turning off the light, the behaviour is GO_LON -> GC_LON and she leaves. A notification helps GC_LON -> GC_LOFF.
    - Bob is coming back home, so it is supposed to be GC_LOFF -> GO_LOFF -> GC_LOFF -> GC_LON. When he forgets to close the garage, the behaviour is then GC_LOFF -> GO_LOFF -> GO_LON. A notification helps GO_LON -> GC_LON.
