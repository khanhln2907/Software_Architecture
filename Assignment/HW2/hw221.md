# How many unique states can the SmartHome system be in? What are the relevant state changes?

Consider the light's status (L: on / NL: off) and garage's status (G: open / NG: close), we have four unique states:
    - Garage open, light on:    G_L
    - Garage open, light off:   G_NL
    - Garage closed, light on:  NG_L
    - Garage closed, light off: NG_NL

The relevant state changes are:
    - G_L to NG_L: notify Alice as she closed the garage without turning off the light. 
    - G_NL -> G_L: notify Bob as he turned off the light without closing the garage 

Under the assumption that being at home is equivalent to turning on the light, the notification should help the user approach users' final states ,which are: 
    - Alice is leaving the house, so it is supposed to be G_L -> G_NL -> NG_NL. If she leaves the house without turning off the light, the behaviour is G_L -> NG_L and she leaves. A notification helps NG_L -> NG_NL.
    - Bob is coming back home, so it is supposed to be NG_NL -> G_NL -> NG_NL -> NG_L. When he forgets to close the garage, the behaviour is then NG_NL -> G_NL -> G_L. A notification helps G_L -> NG_L.
