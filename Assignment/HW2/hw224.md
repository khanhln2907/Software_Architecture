# Response to your colleague who suggests to apply the Pub./Sub. pattern

- The main difference between (Pub./Sub.) (PS) and the Observers (OBS) is the existance of the central hub (let's call it "router" for simplicity) to perform events registration / routing.

1) To publish events, the router needs the expected state transitions from the observers, while the exercise using OBS let each observer check the transitions themself. In this scope, the OBS avoids the coupling and the routing complexity as the SmartHome class does not need any details of its observer.
2) The observer performs some actions synchronously with the state transition.
