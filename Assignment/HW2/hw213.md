# Advantages/Disadvantages of Inheritance vs Composition

Disadvantage: 
    - Using inheritance results in the coupling between the adapter and the adaptee. 
    Example: 
    Taking the example from hw211.py, assume that we have an additional class inherits DimmLight, which needs an additional measurement (let's assume a sensor to measure the day time because we don't want them to be switched on during midnight), the base class "DimmLight" can no longer define the common interfaces "switchState". This implies that for additional classes, they need a new adapter to declares their proper method.

Advantage:
    The adaptees can easily modify the method from the adapter if needed.
    For instance, assume we need an AC dimmlight, the voltage has no longer the minimum 0. By using inheritance, the child class can modify the method setVoltage of the adapter class, while it requires a new adapter for the composition case.
